Remember the first day of every class you've ever had? Introductions. Always introductions. Even in college, when you thought you'd surely escaped the benign banality of "getting-to-know-yous" and "icebreaker activities" â€“ you'd walk in, choose your seat, get the syllabus and then waste 55 minutes introducing yourself. Say your name, your major, where you're from, and one interesting thing about yourself.

In the interest of preserving that good-spirited pointlessness, my name is Renee. I was an English major, Literature concentration, with a minor in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, and I graduated in 2014. I'm from a smallish beach town on the Treasure Coast of Florida. I'm sure if I maintain this properly you're bound to learn plenty of interesting things about me, but for now here's this: I hoard stickers, and have what might be considered sticker anxiety. I don't know what to use them on, but damn I love to collect them.

I don't really know what I intend to do with this blog. Over this past weekend my best friend's mom told me I should start a blog, because, according to her, I have a good sense of humor. I've been wanting to cultivate my writerly voice anyway, so hopefully this will help with that. And, while we're already knee-deep in January, it still counts as a fulfillment of a New Years' resolution if it starts in January, right? 

Right.

So, I guess, here's my blog! It isn't going to be a fashion blog or a food blog or a movie blog, but it'll be updated periodically and I'll try to make it interesting. Pretend this is important to you, and I'll try to do the same.
